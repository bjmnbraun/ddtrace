DDTraceGraph is a graphing tool used to make pretty figures of DDTrace analysis
data.

To use:

1) Install openframeworks, see 
  http://openframeworks.cc/

2) Copy config.make.nonlocal to config.make 

3) Open config.make and change OF_ROOT to point to the root of your
openFrameworks installation
    NOTE: Alternatively, if you set the environmental variable OF_ROOT to point
    to the root of your OF installation, you don't need to modify config.make

4) make

5) cd bin

6) ./DDtraceGraph <any number of .ddt files, such as those output from hello_world_consumer> 

The output graph is in data/DDTraceGraph.pdf (within the bin directory)
