First, you may consider checking out the following resources on ddtrace to see
if it's what you're looking for:

First run configure:

1) ./configure

NOTE: If you have an older computer without perf_event_open rdpmc-in-userspace
enabled by default, try ./configure.ramcloud instead.

NOTE: If you are running on ramcloud use ./configure.ramcloud ;)

NOTE: This runs our own configuration script, which is not related to
autoconf, etc.

2) make

To install the library:

3) sudo make install

NOTE: sudo make clean-install undoes the above command

OR, to use the library without installing, just
add this directory to your include path and link path, i.e.:

3) DDTRACE_HOME=<path to this directory>
   When compiling: <compiler command> -I$(DDTRACE_HOME)
   When linking: <linker command> -L$(DDTRACE_HOME)

Finally, to compile against DDTrace just pass -lddtrace to the linker

4) When linking: <linker command> -lddtrace

See examples for example applications
